## Setup
To use Kody, firstly install the fabric tool.
Check out fabric's github page for your proeferred way of installation and setup: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric

Or if you wish you can download it directly from source (golang) : go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest

Next is to setup fabric with your ai model: thorugh fabric --setup

Once your fabric thig is done: 
Install the tool:
```
git clone https://github.com/kripto-geek/kody.git
cd kody
python kody.py
```

You can set the export this tool's PATH to be accessible globally. Make sure to launch the tool in the directory where your project exist or where you want to create a project. Launching in home directory will make the tool load all unnecessary things from whole system and reach its limit.
