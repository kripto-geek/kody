## Setup

Modify the config.json with your api key. Currently the config is setup with openrouter, So you can just go and grab the **free** openrouter key and replace your key. You can change the model based on your needs. Currently using free deepseek model (It's the one on which the tool is tested the most) 

```
git clone https://github.com/kripto-geek/kody.git
cd kody
pip install -r requirements.txt
python kody.py
```

You can set the export this tool's PATH to be accessible globally. Make sure to launch the tool in the directory where your project exist or where you want to create a project. Launching in home directory will make the tool load all unnecessary things from whole system and reach its limit.
